					Hi there! üëã I'm Anna.
				</p>
				<p>
					Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
				</p>
				<p>
					Born and raised in Zimbabwe, a true African at heart, I care deeply about people.  And so, I decided to study psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.  I've always been curious about the way the world works, and not only how it works, but why it works that way specifically - and that includes how people work, and why they work that way.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the pandemic hit, I too went through the classic reassessment of my life, and decided that I wanted a change.  This led me to tech - specifically software engineering.  I had been doing some graphic design for my sister and realised how much I loved being creative as well as technical on the computer, and thought I should research this further - and the internet answered with a resounding ‚Äúsoftware engineering is the place for you!‚Äù  So, I looked around to see what I could do to make this happen and explore if this was actually a good fit for me, and I was referred to a Generation UK & Ireland Tech Talent Accelerator program - a 6-week bootcamp that would teach me the specifics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with TypeScript thrown in there for good measure).
				</p>
				<p>
					What I didn't realise was, this would change my life.  Firstly, I was given the opportunity to pursue something that genuinely sparked my interest and reignited a fascination in life that I hadn't felt in years.  I was given the opportunity to create some wonderful projects (check them out here!), and be part of two particularly big projects - the first collaborating to create a snowball fight game, using JavaScript, TypeScript, and a whole bunch of Git too, and the second, acting as Scrum Master to develop a construction simulation game, that largely resembles Jenga, to see how many springs you can remove from a structure (with applied gravity on all the springs) before the whole thing collapses.  This also allowed me to really soar with my maths and physics abilities, as well as to conceive tangible possibilities of what this could look like.  These were both group projects, allowing me to work with some incredible people, and giving me the chance to experience what working in the tech industry would really be like.  And let me tell you, I loved it.
